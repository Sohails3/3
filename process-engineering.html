    <h1>Process Engineering Industrial Placement</h1>
    <p>
      During my year in industry I worked on a production line
      <ul>
  <li>Focused on improving the efficiency of a production line by developing innovative solutions to address challenges in its mechanical operation. Working with cross-functional teams, improving analytical, technical, communication, teamwork and problem-solving skills.</li>
  <li>Significantly enhanced the performance of machines, through analysis and optimising adjustments. Reducing downtime of one machine from 5.09% to 2.28% within one month, leading to an additional 216,000 bottles produced and saving 315kg of plastic waste, through reducing damaged bottles.</li>
  <li>Standardised procedures, through creating documentation and training procedures out to operators.</li>
  <li>Advancing waste reduction initiatives, including reducing the water used in wash cycles.</li>
  <li>Designing and Manufacturing projects, such as a reject system for incorrectly orientated bottles.</li>
  <li>Daily Data Analysis on Microsoft Excel to constantly identify which areas needed improvement and develop insights that informed key decisions on production improvements.</li>
  <li>Found and implemented optimal parameters of the machinery for the packaging of a new product.</li>
  <li>Developed a digital application where production data can be recorded on Microsoft Power Apps.</li>
  <li>Created a Web scraping script using Python, that would automatically extract various data.</li>
      </ul>
